#### Main Question: *How can the use of computing raise legal and ethical concerns?*


## Introduction:
As intellectual property and technology evolve, understanding digital licensing, fair use, and access is crucial for legal and ethical reasons.

In this Team Teach, we'll explore these principles and their role in innovation and creativity.



## Legal Concerns Topics:
- Intellectual Property(IP)
- Creative Commons License (Fair Use, Copyright)
- Open Source/Access


### Intellectual Property()

* Intellectual property refers to original works or creations born from creativity, for which the creator holds legal rights.

Examples of this are names, symbols, images, drawings, code(if not open-sourced), designs, etc.

The person who thought of this and made it, own it

Ever since things have been digitized, digital information (everything online) can be easily distributed and saved on computers, and our IP can be accessed quicker and easier, raising concerns about whether someone is allowed to use someone else creation

There are legal ways to use materials created by someone else, which include Creative Commons, Open Source, and Open Access

### Creative Commons License (Fair, Use, Copyright)

Creative commons provides free 


## Ethical Concerns Topics:
- Digital Divide
- Reasons for the Divide

### Digital Divide:
- Unequal distribution of access to technology
- eg. senior citizens, low income people, people in rural areas, and some races and ethnicities don't have equal access or understanding of content or resources

#### Reasons for the Divide:
- Because there is less internet infrastructure in rural areas, people that live there may have little to no access to the internet
- Technology can be expensive, and families with little to no income or in areas where electronics are relatively expensive may not be able to buy devices to access the internet
    - For instance, technology is the most expensive in Venezuela or Angola, but the countries themselves have a low average income and GDP per capita
